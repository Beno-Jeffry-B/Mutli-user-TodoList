## 🎯 Why I Created Taskify

I built **Taskify** out of my own struggle with time management. Between college, personal goals, and side projects, I constantly felt overwhelmed. The apps I tried didn’t work the way I needed. So, I created something simple for me.

But when I shared it with friends, I realized I wasn’t alone. Everyone was fighting the same battle. That’s when Taskify became more than just a personal project it became a tool to help anyone bring order to chaos.

I built Taskify to solve these problems in the simplest way possible  a minimal, fast, and functional task management app that helps you:

- Stay focused  
- Manage tasks based on **priority and due date**  
- Track progress using **Not Started, In Progress, and Completed** status  
- Get things done without the distraction of complex UI  

Whether it’s for managing homework, project tasks, or daily to-dos , Taskify helps bring clarity and control back to your schedule.
Especially **graph-like visualization** helped me see patterns in my productivity when I was most active, where I was falling behind, and how I could better prioritize tasks going forward. It turned abstract to-dos into measurable progress, which kept me motivated.
